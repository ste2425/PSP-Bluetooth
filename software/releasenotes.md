## Changes

The default warm boot time was 2.5 seconds. However some people report that this is not enough time to ensure the PSP is properly booted before enabling TV out.

As such the default time has been extended to 5 seconds.

**⚠ IMPORTANT NOTE ⚠** This only applies to users who have not saved settings on the `Settings Page`. Otherwise the saved settings will be applied.
