## Changes

* Changed the button combo to change a button mapping from `L1` & `R1` & `DPADRight` to `L1` & `R1` `Select` & `Start` & `DPADRight`.
* Added a button combo to press the Display screen 
	* This should solve any issues people have where either TVOut is not enabled or some homebrew disables it. Fixes [#16](https://github.com/ste2425/PSP-Bluetooth/issues/16), [#18](https://github.com/ste2425/PSP-Bluetooth/issues/18)
* Lowered the threshold of the analog to button mappings. This will make diaganals work but will also make the stick more sensitive. Will leave like this and wait for feedback. Fixes [#17](https://github.com/ste2425/PSP-Bluetooth/issues/17)
